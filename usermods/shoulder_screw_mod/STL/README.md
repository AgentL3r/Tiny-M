### Shoulder screw mod

This is a mod to use shoulder screws instead of regular metric screws as the shafts for the idlers to ride upon.  

Shoulder screws are machined to specified dimensions vs screws which are undersized and often have a rough surface.  With undersized screws the contact area of the screw to the inner race of the bearing is much less (ideally a line), creating excessive Hertzian contact stress.  This is hard on the bearing and can create imprecision in the motion of the machine.

This mod uses Misumi 5mm shoulder screws which have 3mm threads on the end.   Most other shoulder screws have 4mm threads.  It should be possible to drill out the threads on the bottoms of the two XY joins and tap that M4 to use 4mm threaded shoulders if access to those are easier for you.

On the four corners of Tiny-M the ends of the 2020s are tapped M5 for M5 screws.  If using Misumi shoulders, you will need thread adapters.   If using M4 shoulders you will need M4 Helicoils
