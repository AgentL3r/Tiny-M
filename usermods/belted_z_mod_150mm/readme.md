![Back](https://github.com/gsl12/Tiny-M/blob/master/usermods/belted_z_mod_150mm/Images/CAD%20back.png)

Modified from V0 belted z mod for large build volume printer, 2020 extrusions, and to upgrade some bolts from M3 to M5.

CAD shows a printed 80T gear because I copied that over from the V0 belted z files, but I used a metal 80T gear.

The M5x20mm screws need to be BHCS for clearance with 80T gear, but all other bolts can be either SHCS or BHCS.
