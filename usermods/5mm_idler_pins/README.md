This is a mod to use 5mm dowel pins instead of fasteners for the idlers to ride on. 

####RATIONALE
Dowel pins are exactly 5mm in diameter vs the typical 4.8mm of screws.  This provides a better bearing surface for the inner race of the idler bearings.  
It should prolong the life of the bearings and improve print quality.

####BOM
  - 10x 5mmx32mm dowel pins.  [McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/91585A569/).  30mm pins may be substituted.
