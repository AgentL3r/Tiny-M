# Tiny-M


This is a Corona project. It is based on [Voron V0](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0) . 

## Why the whole thing?

I had many 3D printer parts in my pocket from my old no longer used printer. 
I cleared out my pocket and took what i had in the box without buying anything new.
After checking all parts, i recognize, that i could build a converted Voron V0 with this parts.

### Hardware

I used 20x20 profiles, MGN9 for XY and MGN12 for Z.

### Data
Build volume: 150x150x150 mm
