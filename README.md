# Tiny-M


This is a Corona project.  
It is based on [Voron V0](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0) .  
As extruder i used [Voron Jetpack](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Jetpack-Extruder).

## Why the whole thing?

I had many 3D printer parts in my pocket from my old no longer used printer. 
I cleared out my pocket and took what i had in the box without buying anything new.
After checking all parts, i recognize, that i could build a converted Voron V0 with this parts.
