# Tiny-M

<img src="images/build_p1.jpg" width="200">

This is a Corona project.  
It is based on [Voron V0](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0) .  
As extruder I used [Voron Jetpack](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Jetpack-Extruder).
or my new [Nema17 Pocketwatch](https://github.com/gsl12/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/GSL12/pocketwatch_nema17)
A direct drive extruder using [Annex Engineering's Sherpa Mini](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder) is now available.

Source is available at [Tiny-M Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d2a24a4147c3d522115f6ea5/w/d8f44be5c0a081fbf527e154/e/debb6c2779e27f86389232d5).

This is my first project of this kind. Maybe something will be missing, is not well documented, or just messy. I apologize for that.

## Why the whole thing?

I had many 3D printer parts in my pocket from my old no longer used printer. 
I cleared out my pocket and took what I had in the box without buying anything new.
After checking all parts, I recognize, that I could build a converted Voron V0 with this parts.

### Hardware

    - alu profiles 2020 Nut 5 I-Typ (6mm wide slot Misumi 2020 will work)
    - MGN9H for XY
    - MGN12H for Z
    - FYSETC Cheetah V1.1b (TMC2209) config here  or SKR Mini E3 with TMC2209
    - 24V everywhere

### BOM
DRAFT BOM is available now. Thanks to CookieSN !

### Build Tips
There are 2 versions of the XY-Joins.

- V2 - use 2GT 20T pulleys - No Set Screw Hub
    - The outer diameter of the flanges from the pulleys for XY Joins will not fit.
    - You will need to grind the flanges to fit.
- V3 - use 2GT 20T toothed idler and no M5 Nuts

### User Mods
There are several user mod STLs in the usermods directory.
